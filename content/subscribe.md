I don't currently send out emails, but I might in the future. If that's something that is of interest, then subscribe below:

<form
  action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/aussienomics"
  method="post"
  target="popupwindow"
  onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/aussienomics', 'popupwindow')"
  class="embeddable-buttondown-form"
>
  <label for="bd-email">Enter your email</label>
  <input style="width: 100%;padding: 1rem 2rem;margin: 8px 0;box-sizing: border-box;" type="email" name="email" id="bd-email" />
  <input style="background-color: #e7e7e7; color: black;border: none;padding: 1rem 2rem;text-align: center;text-decoration: none;display: inline-block;" type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
</form>

If enough people sign up I'll certainly start sending posts as part of a newsletter!
