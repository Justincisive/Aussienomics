Opposition leader Peter Dutton isn't happy about the [RBA's decision](https://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2023/mr-23-02.html) to replace the late Queen on the $5 bill with "a new design that honours the culture and history of the First Australians":

> "There's no question about this that it's directed by the government and I think the Prime Minister should own up to it," [Mr Dutton told 2GB](https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/dutton-tells-albanese-to-own-up-to-claim-government-directed-rbas-decision-on-queen-elizabeths-replacement-on-5-note/news-story/db982d870898c94173b120180c776193).

I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that the omission of the King on the $5 bill is an "attack". There's no legal requirement to have a monarch on Australian banknotes, unlike [its coins](https://www.ramint.gov.au/heads-or-tails-0). The fewer faces of monarchs and politicians on our currency, the better, I say!

But where Dutton *really* erred is that in attacking this decision he risks undermining his legitimate concerns about the proposed Voice to Parliament. The government will just increase its 'Dutton is racist and will just oppose *anything* to do with the Indigenous' rhetoric, deflecting from the serious lack of details about something that could potentially be an *actual* attack on our institutions.

We just don't know -- which is why it's important to push for details before voting it into the constitution.
