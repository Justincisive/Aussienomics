You might think that anthropogenic climate change is a major issue and that decarbonisation should be front and centre of policy. But that's no excuse for this [shoddy bit of tweeting](https://twitter.com/DavidPocock/status/1621414861451456516) from Senator Pocock:

> "Big report out today highlighting the scale of emissions from big fossil fuel companies in Australia.
> 
> 12 fossil fuel companies emitted more than half of all pacific countries. Yes, countries.
> 
> Underlines the need to get the safeguard mechanism right."

The 23 Pacific Island [nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oceanian_countries_by_population) have a combined population of about 11 million. They don't have much local manufacturing, export no natural gas and have a [high dependence](https://nautilus.org/trade-and-environment/pacific-islands-economies-trade-patterns-and-some-observations-on-trade-policy-issues-4/) "to an unusual degree, on imported goods and services".

In other words, they are *nothing like Australia*.

How does comparing the emissions from these nations with Australia's largest natural gas producers add any value to what should be an important, fact-based discussion? Noting of course that without Australia's natural gas exports (an important transition fuel) -- [about 75%](https://www.ga.gov.au/digital-publication/aecr2021/gas) of total production was exported in 2018-19 -- many Asian nations (the primary destination) would have to burn something *even dirtier* instead, such as coal.

The answer is that it doesn't, and Senator Pocock is being deliberately misleading in an effort to push his political agenda (and perhaps pay back his [largest campaign donor](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/8067709/the-war-chest-which-helped-a-rugby-star-blast-zed-seselja-out-of-parliament/), Simon Holmes a Court's Climate 200). But it's not helpful to further the discussion, and his Twitter handlers should know better than to parrot "research" from the Climate Council, a group [headed by](https://www.abc.net.au/local/archives/landline/content/2006/s1844398.htm) none other than Tim Flannery.[1]

[1] In 2004 Flannery [predicted that](https://www.smh.com.au/environment/sydneys-future-eaten-the-flannery-prophecy-20040519-gdiyd2.html) "Perth will be the 21st century's first ghost metropolis". Perth recorded its second-wettest year ever in 2017 and annual rainfall in 2021 was [9% above](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/annual/wa/summary.shtml) the 1961–1990 average. Flannery also predicted that "the eastern states are only 30 years behind [Perth]", and by 2050 Sydney [could have](https://www.smh.com.au/environment/sydneys-future-eaten-the-flannery-prophecy-20040519-gdiyd2.html) 60% less rainfall each year. Rainfall in Sydney hit at [an all-time record high](https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/sydney-set-to-break-stunning-weather-record-after-lengthy-streak-of-no-hot-days/news-story/bad3fcb1711dea948399ba491277620e) in 2022 with 2530 mm of rainfall – more than twice the city's long-term annual average.
