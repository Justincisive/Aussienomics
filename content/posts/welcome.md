Welcome to Aussienomics, an Australian economics-themed blog. This website has existed since 2009 but was in hibernation for nearly a decade between 2013 and now (late 2022).

Posting will likely be sporadic. It may also have nothing to do with economics or Australia, as sometimes I just want to save something for future me, which is exactly what you'll see tomorrow when I post a guide for how to set up blog for free using Oracle Cloud and Ghost (I'll link it here when it goes live)!
