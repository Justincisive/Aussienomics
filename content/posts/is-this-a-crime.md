It certainly sounds like criminal activity perpetrated against the Australian taxpayer. From [The Australian](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/leaders-knew-of-450m-rio-compensation-says-annastacia-palaszczuk/news-story/399beb18f69fc502cf9247ded12ce734):

> "Annastacia Palaszczuk says the federal and state governments knew taxpayers could be slugged up to $450m to compensate mining giant Rio Tinto when the national energy plan was rushed through parliament this month.
>
> Asked if her government was aware the payout could hit $450m before agreeing to implement the cap, Ms Palaszczuk said: 'Yes, we did know.'
>
> 'All of that was worked out when we reached the agreement we reached,' she said in reference to national cabinet negotiations.
>
> Ms Palaszczuk's confirmation contradicted Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's claim that compensation for Rio and its partners would be 'nothing like' $450m."

And against a sitting Senator, whose vote was crucial to getting the legislation passed:

> "Senator Pocock told The Australian he was not informed the compensation deal could reach $450m before he agreed to support the governmentâ€™s legislation at an urgent parliamentary sitting this month.
>
> 'The briefings and information I received suggested that any compensation under this plan to bring much-needed energy price relief for households and small businesses would be minimal and confined to a small number of generators'."

The economics of the Australian government's energy market intervention bill were awful and will cause unintended consequences for years to come (see my prior posts [here](/why-nations-fail/) and [here](/spending-our-way-out-of-inflation/)). Now we find out it's going to cost an extra half a billion dollars up-front, and they willfully lied to rush it through Parliament. What a disaster.
